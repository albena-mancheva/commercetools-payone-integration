TODOs:
 * go through open questions with PAYONE and CT product managers
 * go through PAYONE status notification fields and responses (currently only the requests have been documented here)

# API Data mapping

## TODO: ITEMS TO BE DISCUSSED

With PAYONE:

 *  same issue as with `reference` on the `invoiceid` passed to Klarna. Invoice ID is known only very late in the process.  
 * `userid` on the PAYONE side.  Clarify role and meaning
 * `personalid` ->  What is the meaning of that field?  we won't store passport numbers or such. 
 * `ip` -> the IP address of the user is not stored in CT. -> will need a custom field? (required for Klarna)
 * `pr[n]` (line item unit price) is that a net or a gross price? -> [FH] since payone will only print this on the invoice, it seems indifferent.
 * the CT discounted line item price can have rounding errors because it is actually calculated per individual 
   quantity. i.e. the total sum calculated by PAYONE can deviate from the amount passed for the payment.
 *`sd[n]` "delivery date"  and `ed[n]` delivery end date fields: What is their meaning? 
 * How to determine the `sequence_number` -> just the index of our transactions? all transactions or
    just specific ones? (authorize = 0, charges and refunds counting 1+ , TODO chargeback?  TODO what happens if the sequence has a gap?
   * is the `sequence_number` 1:1 our `transaction.interfaceId`? 
   * Required only from the second capture on!  -> just count Charges in the transactions array? 
 * How to set `capturemode` -> NK discuss internally how to find out that a capture is the last delivery.
   * e.g. IF the sum of Charge transaction amounts incl. the now to do Charge equals amountPlanned, THEN it's the last? 
   * (allowed values: completed / notcompleted ). Mandatory just with Billsafe & Klarna. 
 * What is the `bankbranchcode` and the ` bankcheckdigit` ? -> [FH] branch code is part of the bank identifier code, differs in length e.g. in France, Greece...
 * `xid`, `cavv`, `eci`  for 3dsecure???  what is this stuff?
  * `protect_result_avs`  TODO read what this is. 

With CT Product Management:

 * `customermessage` of an error -> was discussed at CT to add to PaymentStatus and was discarded until needed. Is needed now. 

## PAYONE fields that map to custom Payment fields

 * All:
   * _Required_ `reference` : should conventionally be the Order Number (assuming just one payment per Order). 
     The OrderNumber is only available on the CT Order, but not the CT Cart.
     Issue at hand: Checkout Implementations vary in respect to whether the Cart is converted into an Order before or after the Order is placed. 
     Proposed behavior:     
     1. check if the Order is there and has an Order Number. Take that as reference.
     1. If note: Create an Order Number and store it into a custom field `reserved_order_number` in the Payment object. 
        An Integration Configuration determines the Custom _Object_ container and ID from which to get the next Order ID. 
        The Checkout implementation that creates Payment before Order then needs to assure that the Order ID
        is taken from the Payment Object if the Order is created after the Payment. 
   *  `narrative_text` :  this is the text on the account statements.  -> TODO custom field in the methods where it matters
   *  `language` / locale
   *  `redirecturl` : where to send the guy (should be multiple fields: method, URI, body) -> 
   *  `invoiceappendix` (comment for all?)  -> 
 *  SEPA:
  * `bankaccountholder` -> 
  * `iban` -> 
  * `mandate_identification` -> 
  * `mandate_dateofsignature` -> 
 * online transfer:
  * `bankgrouptype` (eps & ideal) -> 
 * Credit Card:
  * `pseudocardpan` -> 
  * `ecommercemode` ("internet" or "3dsecure") -> 
   
## Fields not natively defined in CT, covered by custom Fields on Cart, Customer and Order

 * _Optional_ `customermessage`: Check for a custom Field `description` of type `LocalizedString` on the Cart / Order.
   Use the `locale` set on the Payment to pick the right value. 
 
The following are required only for Installment-Type Payment Methods (mainly Klarna): 
 
 * `birthdate` and `vatid` : these fields are only available on the CT Customer and not on the Cart. I.e. Guest checkouts
   cannot do some payment methods.
   * If the fields `dateOfBirth` (type Date) and `vatId` (type String) respectively are set as custom object on the 
     Cart / Order and have the right type they are used and take precedence over the Fields on the Customer Object
 * `gender`: Check the Cart for a custom field `customerGender`, as fallback check the Customer for a custom field 
    named `gender`. If the first existing is of Type `Enum` and has a value `Male` or `Female` -> use that one as `f` or `m` respectively.  
 * `ip`: Check for a custom Field `customerIPAddress` of type `String` on the Cart / Order. 
 
   
## unused PAYONE fields

 * `clearing_*`  prepaid, cash on delivery etc  -> necessary at all? just in an interaction? 
 * `creditor_*`  just for debug? 
 * `bankcountry`, `bankaccount`, `bankcode`, `bic` (all replaced by the IBAN, which is preferable because it has a checksum)

## Transaction Types and States

## PAYONE transaction types -> CT Transaction Types 

### triggering a new PAYONE transaction request given a CT transaction

* TODO how to trigger address / bank data checks? Just a a payment without transaction is not safe because the integration
  service processes the Payment Object change messages asynchronously and could miss the intermediate state without a transaction. 
  * request=bankaccountcheck / addresscheck / consumerscore  
  * As data check is not a financial transaction, we don't want to include it in the Transactions. A special Interaction? But interactions
    aren't supposed to be relevant to the checkout and frontend code. 
* TODO what to write into the CT payment object to trigger an `updatereminder`, i.e. dunning level trigger  
* TODO when does `vauthorization` happen? What is it? 
* TODO when do we need the `managemandate` call? 
* TODO is explicit `3dscheck` (probably rather `check`?) necessary at all or implicit in the preauth/auth? 

Please take care of idempotency. The `TransactionState` alone does not suffice to avoid creating duplicate PAYONE transactions. 
It could remain in `Pending` for various reasons.
`interfaceId`  and `timestamp` of the Transaction can be used to manage idempotency if a persistent field is necessary. 
 
| CT `TransactionType` | CT `TransactionState` | PAYONE `request` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Pending` | `preauthorization` |  |
| `CancelAuthorization` | `Pending` | TODO how to do that?  |  |
| `Charge` | `Pending` | if an `Authorization` Transaction exists: `capture`; otherwise: `authorization`  |  |
| `Refund` | `Pending` | `refund` TODO when to use `debit`? |  |
| `Chargeback` | - | - |  (not applicable, is just triggered from PAYONE to CT)  |

### updating the CT Payment given a PAYONE TransactionStatus Notification

See chapter 4.2.1 "List of events (txaction)" and the sample processes in the PAYONE documentation

* TODO define how to find the right transaction.  `sequence_number`? 

[FH] PAYONE docu says that "you will receive the data and the status for each payment process". So maybe this table should incooperate also the CT PaymentState?
[FH] transaction_status seems to be only available with txaction "appointed" for now

| PAYONE `txaction` | PAYONE `transaction_status` | PAYONE `notify_version` | CT `TransactionType` | CT `TransactionState` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `appointed` | pending |  |  |  |  |
| `appointed` | completed |  |  |  |  |
| `capture` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `paid` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `underpaid` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `cancelation` |  |  |  |  | TODO is that  |
| `refund` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `debit` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `transfer` |  |  |  |  | Transfer like in "switch"/"move to" another bank account |
| `reminder` |  |  |  |  | status of dunning procedure, must be activated by PAYONE |
| `vauthorization` |  |  |  |  | only available with PAYONE Billing module, must be activated |
| `vsettlement` |  |  |  |  | only available with PAYONE Billing module, must be activated |
| `invoice` |  |  |  |  |  |
| `failed` | any | any | TODO all? charges? the one with the right sequence_number?  | `Failure` | (not fully implemented at PAYONE yet) |

## Payment Method specific fields of the payment object

Please use the commercetools custom payment types (per method) from the [method type specifications](https://github.com/nkuehn/payment-integration-specifications/blob/master/Method-Keys.md) in the payment specifications project. 

### CREDIT_CARD

#### commercetools payment object custom fields

`custom.fields.` has to be prefixed when actually accessing these fields.  

| CT Payment custom property | PAYONE Server API | Who is Master? | Value transform |
|---|---|---|---|
| foo |  |  |  |
| foo |  |  |  |

### DIRECTDEBIT_SEPA

XXXX ... analogous to the Credit Card sample above ... 

# Constraint Rules to be implemented by the Integration

* If payment method INSTALLMENT-KLARNA or BILLSAFE are used, billing address and 
delivery address must be identical.
