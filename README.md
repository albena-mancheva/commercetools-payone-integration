# commercetools <-> PAYONE Integration Service

This software provides an integration between the (commercetools eCommerce platform)[http://dev.sphere.io] API
and the (PAYONE)[http://www.payone.de] payment service provider API. 

It is a standalone Microservice that connects the two cloud platforms and provides own helper APIs to checkout
implementations.
