# commercetools <-> PAYONE Integration Service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration.svg?token=BGS8vSNxuriRBqs9Ffzs&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration)

This software provides an integration between the [commercetools eCommerce platform](http://dev.sphere.io) API
and the [PAYONE](http://www.payone.de) payment service provider API. 

It is a standalone Microservice that connects the two cloud platforms and provides own helper APIs to checkout
implementations.

## Using the Integration in a project

TODO

### Required Configuration in commercetools

TODO

### Required Configuration in PAYONE

https://pmi.pay1.de/

 * create a Payment Portal of type "Shop" for the site you are planning (please also maintain separate portal for 
   automated testing, demo systems etc.)
 * set the hashing algorithm to sha2-384  ("advanced" tab in the portal config)
 * put the notification listener URL of where you will deploy the microservice into "Transaction Status URL" in the 
   "advanced" tab of the portal
 * configure the "riskcheck" settings as intended (esp. 3Dsecure)

-> DO NOT USE A MERCHANT ACCOUNT ACROSS commercetools projects, you may end up mixing customer accounts (debitorenkonten). 

### Configuration Options of the Integration itself

TODO 

### Deploy and Run

TODO docker and (complete) heroku options

#### Configuration via Environment Variables

The integration service requires - _unless otherwise stated_ - the following environment variables:

##### <a name="configEnvCtCredentials"> commercetools API client credentials

Name | Content
---- | -------
`CT_PROJECT_KEY` | the project key
`CT_CLIENT_ID` | the client id
`CT_CLIENT_SECRET` | the client secret

Can be found in [Commercetools Merchant Center](https://admin.sphere.io/).

##### PAYONE API client credentials

Name | Content
---- | -------
`PAYONE_PORTAL_ID` | Payment portal ID
`PAYONE_KEY` | Payment portal key
`PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID` | Merchant account ID
`PAYONE_SUBACC_ID` | Subaccount ID

Can be found in the [PAYONE Merchant Interface](https://pmi.pay1.de/).

##### Service configuration parameters

All optional.

Name | Content | Default
---- | ------- | --------
`CRON_NOTATION` | cron expression to specify when the service will poll for commercetools messages like [PaymentInteractionAdded](http://dev.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-messages.html#payment-interaction-added-message) | poll every 30 seconds
`PAYONE_MODE` | the mode of operation with PAYONE <ul><li>`"live"` for production mode, (i.e. _actual payments_) or</li><li>`"test"` for test mode</li></ul> | `"test"`  
`CT_START_FROM_SCRATCH` | :warning: _**Handle with care!**_ If and only if equal, ignoring case, to `"true"` the service will create the custom types it needs. _**Therefor it first deletes all Order, Cart, Payment and Type entities**_. See [issue #34](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/issues/34). | `"false"`

### Notes to the checkout implementation

 1. If the PAYONE invoice generation feature or the Klarna payment methods are to be supported, the checkout has to make
    sure that 
    `amountPlanned = Sum over all Line Items ( round ( totalPrice.centAmount / quantity ) * quantity ))` 
    and handle deviations accordingly.  Deviations can especially occur if absolute discounts are applied and there are
    Line Items with quantity > 1.  On deviations the Line Item Data will not be transferred to PAYONE. 

## Test environments

SEE PAYONE DOCUMENTATION - ALL TEST DATA THERE, JUST PAYPAL REQUIRES AN OWN ACCOUNT

### Functional Tests

The executable specification (using [Concordion](http://concordion.org/)) requires the following environment variables
in addition to the [commercetools API client credentials](#configEnvCtCredentials):

Name | Content
---- | -------
`CT_PAYONE_INTEGRATION_URL` | the URL of the service instance under test
`TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_NO_3DS` | the pseudocardpan of an unconfirmed VISA credit card
`TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_3DS` | the pseudocardpan of a VISA credit card verified by 3-D Secure

To run the executable specification invoke the following command line:

```
./gradlew :functionaltests:cleanTest :functionaltests:testSpec
```

Omit `:functionaltests:cleanTest` to run the tests only if something (f.i. the specification) has changed.

### Paypal Sandbox Account

https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/ug_sandbox/

To test, you need to be logged in with the developer account and then use the Sandbox Buyer credentials in the checkout (see below). 

Developer Acccount: create your own or use an existing company internal one (CT has one just in case)
