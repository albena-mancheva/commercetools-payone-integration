        <h1>Charge Credit Card Immediately</h1>
        <p>
            The integration service allows to charge a credit card in a one step process without initiating a separate authorization before.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Note: it is necessary to do a creditcardcheck via PAYONE client API to avoid complying to PCI-DSS standard.
            </i>
        </p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Successful Charge</h3>
            <p>
                If I charge a credit card with an amount without authorizing it before, an interfaceInteraction is added to the payment:
                and after that, an "authorization" request to PAYONE will be sent.
                The PAYONE response will lead to changes in the interfaceInteraction:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Pending Charge</h3>
            <p>
                If I charge a credit card with an amount without authorizing it before, an interfaceInteraction is added to the payment:
                and after that, an "authorization" request to PAYONE will be sent with status PENDING.
                No changes to the interfaceInteraction will be made.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Successful Charge with redirect (3-D Secure)</h3>
